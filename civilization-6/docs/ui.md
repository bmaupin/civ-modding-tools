# UI modding

#### File naming convention

When making UI changes, the file can have any name. But the convention is:

- Put files in UI/Replacements
- Start file with the name of the lua file in the game it's modifying
  - Since filenames on Linux are all lower-cased, you can get the original filename from SteamDB: https://steamdb.info/depot/289071/
- End the file with the name of the mod

e.g.

```
UI/Replacements/GovernmentScreen_MiniCivVI.lua
```
